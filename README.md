## THEORY:

A logic gate is a basic building block of a digital circuit that has two inputs and one output. 
The relationship between the i/p and the o/p is based on a certain logic. These gates are
implemented using electronic switches like transistors, diodes. But, in practice, basic logic
gates are built using CMOS technology, FETS, and MOSFET(Metal Oxide Semiconductor FET)s. Logic
gates are used in microprocessors, microcontrollers, embedded system applications, and in electronic
and electrical project circuits. The basic logic gates are categorized into seven:
AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and NOT. These logic gates with their logic gate symbols and truth tables are explained below.

What are the 7 Basic Logic Gates?
The basic logic gates are classified into seven types: AND gate, OR gate, XOR gate, NAND gate, NOR gate, XNOR gate,
and NOT gate. The truth table is used to show the logic gate function. All the logic gates have two 
inputs except the NOT gate, which has only one input.

When drawing a truth table, the binary values 0 and 1 are used. Every possible combination depends on the 
number of inputs. If you don’t know about the logic gates and their truth tables and need guidance on them
, please go through the following infographic that gives an overview of logic gates with their symbols and truth tables.

Why we use Basic Logic Gates?
The basic logic gates are used to perform fundamental logical functions. These are the basic
building blocks in the digital ICs (integrated circuits). Most of the logic gates use two binary inputs and
generates a single output like 1 or 0. In some electronic circuits, few logic gates are used whereas in some
other circuits, microprocessors include millions of logic gates.

The implementation of Logic gates can be done through diodes, transistors, relays, molecules, and optics otherwise
different mechanical elements. Because of this reason, basic logic gates are used like electronic circuits.

Binary & Decimal
Before talking about the truth tables of logic gates, it is essential to know the background of
binary & decimal numbers. We all know the decimal numbers which we utilize in everyday calculations
like 0 to 9. This kind of number system includes the base-10. In the same way, binary numbers like 0 and 1
can be utilized to signify decimal numbers wherever the base of the binary numbers is 2.

The significance of using binary numbers here is to signify the switching position otherwise voltage
position of a digital component. Here 1 represents the High signal or high voltage whereas “0” specifies
low voltage or low signal. Therefore, Boolean algebra was started. After that, each logic gate is discussed
separately this contains the logic of the gate, truth table, and its typical symbol.

Types of Logic Gates
The different types of logic gates and symbols with truth tables are discussed below.

AND Gate
The AND gate is a digital logic gate with ‘n’ i/ps one o/p, which performs logical conjunction
based on the combinations of its inputs. The output of this gate is true only when all the inputs 
are true. When one or more inputs of the AND gate’s i/ps are false, then only the output of the AND
gate is false. The symbol and truth table of an AND gate with two inputs is shown below.

OR Gate
The OR gate is a digital logic gate with ‘n’ i/ps and one o/p, that performs logical conjunction
based on the combinations of its inputs. The output of the OR gate is true only when one or more 
inputs are true. If all the i/ps of the gate are false, then only the output of the OR gate is false.
The symbol and truth table of an OR gate with two inputs is shown below.

NOT Gate
The NOT gate is a digital logic gate with one input and one output that operates an inverter operation 
of the input. The output of the NOT gate is the reverse of the input. When the input of the NOT gate is
true then the output will be false and vice versa. The symbol and truth table of a NOT gate with one input is 
shown below. By using this gate, we can implement NOR and NAND gates

NAND Gate
The NAND gate is a digital logic gate with ‘n’ i/ps and one o/p, that performs the operation of the AND gate
followed by the operation of the NOT gate.NAND gate is designed by combining the AND and NOT gates. If the
input of the NAND gate high, then the output of the gate will be low.The symbol and truth table of the NAND gate 
with two inputs is shown below.


NOR Gate
The NOR gate is a digital logic gate with n inputs and one output, that performs the operation of the OR gate 
followed by the NOT gate. NOR gate is designed by combining the OR and NOT gate. When any one of the i/ps of
the NOR gate is true, then the output of the NOR gate will be false. The symbol and truth table of the NOR gate with 
the truth table is shown below.


Exclusive-OR Gate
The Exclusive-OR gate is a digital logic gate with two inputs and one output. The short form of this gate is Ex-OR. It
performs based on the operation of the OR gate. . If any one of the inputs of this gate is high, then the output of the 
EX-OR gate will be high. The symbol and truth table of the EX-OR are shown below.

Exclusive-NOR Gate
The Exclusive-NOR gate is a digital logic gate with two inputs and one output. The short form of 
this gate is Ex-NOR. It performs based on the operation of the NOR gate. When both the inputs of this
gate are high, then the output of the EX-NOR gate will be high. But, if any one of the inputs is high
(but not both), then the output will be low. The symbol and truth table of the EX-NOR are shown below.
